# Tokens

Contains Solidity smart contract code to issue a simple token on Ethereum. It can be used to create any form of asset, currency, coin, hours, usage tokens, vunk, etc.  

It based on the idea that creator of the token contract issues the initial & total supply. This is a Truffle repo that contains the code as well as a suite of tests.  

It follows the cutting edge standards (which is de facto finalised by the community here: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20). Following this standard allows other contract developers to easily incorporate your token into their application (governance, exchanges, games, etc). It will be updated as often as possible.  

Pull requests are welcome! Please keep standards discussions to the EIP repos.
