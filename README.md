# Tokens

This is a repo containing various contracts, templates & full-blown dapps related to token systems on Ethereum. It will be fleshed out over time.

Contracts contains Solidity contracts, ready to be built upon.  
Templates contain front-end components, where the developer can change basic parameters for a token system and then deploy it themselves, having a skin available.  
Projects are more full-blown dapps developed by ConsenSys for use in Ethereum directly related to token systems (such as a dapp factory).

"You get a token, you get a token, everyone gets a token!"
