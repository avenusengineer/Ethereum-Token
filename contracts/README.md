# Contracts

This is a directory of Token contracts for various uses cases. From simplistic, standardised ones to complex ones with modular hook functionality. To be fleshed out.

## Tests

Tests are written in Truffle (thus the extra nesting).

## Outdated Contracts

Currently, the standard factory is the defacto standard. More complex token contracts will be written later (and brought back out).
