# Personal Token 

This is a simple token template for a personal token. The idea is that you can replace the config.json with your name, image and address of the token contract. It must follow a similar format in order to properly scaffold the input form (notably the "sendToken" function).

It uses React in the front-end currently to scaffold this form/input. Perhaps slightly overkill at the moment, but useful for future templating.

It uses Bower to install the front-end components. Will flesh out proper installation/tutorial soon.
